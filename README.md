**B4** is an ambitious project of a small **Robot** based on **ROS**, designed primarily for home use, whose purpose is to interact with people and things that manage or monitor the domestic environment, but it could be used in any environment that needs to be controlled.
Its name reads "Before", as well as being the quote of the name of a character in a TV series, indicates that it is a "First" version.

The hardware of the **B4** project is based on a [PINE 64](https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=1194) board, that running [Ubuntu Linux](https://www.ubuntu.com/), [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) and all the software needed for operation, a [Microsoft Kinect](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Kinect) is used as a depth camera. Other hardware devices are [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) used for various tasks and a [uNav](http://unav.officinerobotiche.it/technical-specifications/) plus [uBridge](http://unav.officinerobotiche.it/%C2%B5bridge-technical-specifications/), two [Officine Robotiche](https://github.com/officinerobotiche) projects, used to control and drive the Robot's DC Motors.

**B4** can create a **2D map** of the environment, typically an apartment, and navigate independently. Among its capabilities there are those of interacting with other specific devices, such as alarm sensors, environment monitoring, etc.

More information on how to build **B4** and all the experiments and tests carried out, are available at **[Wiki pages](https://github.com/bobboteck/B4/wiki)**.
